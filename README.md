# Tzo ðŸ’Ž - a simple Virtual Stack Machine

Tzo is a simple Virtual Stack Machine. Its primary use case is to be implemented and embedded in games for a potentially wide variety of use cases. It is the default runtime engine for [QuestMark](https://github.com/jorisvddonk/questmark).

This repository defines:

* The Tzo Virtual Machine and its capabilities and featureset.
* The Tzo Standard Runtime - opcodes that VM implementations are _expected_ to impleemnt.
* One (or more) _representations_ of Tzo VM programs (instruction lists) and Tzo VM State.

This repository furthermore contains:

* A Reference Implementation, in TypeScript.
* Testcases and other reference material.

Note that Tzo is a _hobby project_ that is primarily focused around a single (set of) use case(s). Several language features _may or may not_ be added later on in the future.

# Design goals

* Easy to implement.
* Machine-readable code (JSON) that is somewhat human-readable, and can easily be parsed and minimized to other usecase specific representations when needed (e.g. if a game MUST be super small and compressed, a game programmer can spend some time on a custom bytecode representation of a program listing).
* Easy to compile to / generate code for.
* Easy to extend with extra, use-case-specific functionality (Virtual Opcodes).

# VM 

The Tzo virtual machine is at its core a simple stack machine. All _standard operations_ operate on the stack, not on registers. That said, there _is_ a "Context" available, which acts as a place to store and retrieve keyed values. This is particularly useful for game scripting, as this is where you can store part of your game's state.

Each item on the stack can either be a _number_ (floating point or integer), or a _string_. There are no booleans inherently. The size and precision of numbers is left as an implementation detail. The reference implementation in this repository uses JavaScript's basic number type (64 bit floating point) for all numbers.

# Opcodes

*NOTE*: Even if not explicitly mentioned, all arguments are _always_ popped off the stack, and not pushed back onto it unless otherwise explicitly mentioned.
