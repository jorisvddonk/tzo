# Tzo ðŸ’Ž - a simple Virtual Stack Machine

Tzo is a simple Virtual Stack Machine. Its primary use case is to be implemented and embedded in games for a potentially wide variety of use cases. It is the default runtime engine for [QuestMark](https://github.com/jorisvddonk/questmark).

This repository defines:

* The Tzo Virtual Machine and its capabilities and featureset.
* The Tzo Standard Runtime - opcodes that VM implementations are _expected_ to impleemnt.
* One (or more) _representations_ of Tzo VM programs (instruction lists) and Tzo VM State.

This repository furthermore contains:

* A Reference Implementation, in TypeScript.
* Testcases and other reference material.

Note that Tzo is a _hobby project_ that is primarily focused around a single (set of) use case(s). Several language features _may or may not_ be added later on in the future.

# Design goals

* Easy to implement.
* Machine-readable code (JSON) that is somewhat human-readable, and can easily be parsed and minimized to other usecase specific representations when needed (e.g. if a game MUST be super small and compressed, a game programmer can spend some time on a custom bytecode representation of a program listing).
* Easy to compile to / generate code for.
* Easy to extend with extra, use-case-specific functionality (Virtual Opcodes).

# VM 

The Tzo virtual machine is at its core a simple stack machine. All _standard operations_ operate on the stack, not on registers. That said, there _is_ a "Context" available, which acts as a place to store and retrieve keyed values. This is particularly useful for game scripting, as this is where you can store part of your game's state.

Each item on the stack can either be a _number_ (floating point or integer), or a _string_. There are no booleans inherently. The size and precision of numbers is left as an implementation detail. The reference implementation in this repository uses JavaScript's basic number type (64 bit floating point) for all numbers.

Each instruction in the program list (_either_ an opcode invocation, a string literal to be pushed onto the stack, or a number literal to be pushed onto the stack) takes up 1 space in the program list. The program list starts at 0.

# Opcodes

The following section describes all opcodes from the standard runtime, which implementations are expected to implement. Note that it is also possible to push string or number literals onto the stack; this is not documented here as there is no associated opcode for that.

*NOTE*: Even if not explicitly mentioned, all arguments are _always_ popped off the stack, and not pushed back onto it unless otherwise explicitly mentioned.

# Standard Representation

The Standard Representation of Tzo VM code is a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "push-number-instruction",
    "value": 42
  },
  {
    "type": "push-string-instruction",
    "value": "Foo"
  },
  {
    "type": "invoke-function-instruction",
    "functionName": "setContext"
  }
]
```

Though not space-efficient, this is *very* easy to parse in a wide variety of languages, and well-specified. If more space-efficient representations are preferred, custom integrations can be made to allow this.

Comments can be added to add clarification, where needed:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "push-number-instruction",
    "value": 0
  },
  {
    "type": "invoke-function-instruction",
    "functionName": "jgz"
  },
  {
    "type": "invoke-function-instruction",
    "functionName": "{"
  },
  {
    "type": "push-string-instruction",
    "functionName": "hi",
    "comment": "This instruction will never be invoked!"
  },
  {
    "type": "invoke-function-instruction",
    "functionName": "}"
  }
]
```

Labels can be placed (to serve as jump targets for the `goto` opcode) on any instruction as well:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "push-number-instruction",
    "value": 1
  },
  {
    "type": "push-string-instruction",
    "value": "Awesome",
    "comment": "This will set the program counter to whatever value is pointed to by the \"Awesome\" label"
  },
  {
    "type": "invoke-function-instruction",
    "functionName": "goto"
  },
  {
    "type": "push-number-instruction",
    "value": 2,
    "comment": "Due to the goto above, this instruction will be skipped, and so 2 won't be pushed to the stack"
  },
  {
    "type": "push-number-instruction",
    "value": 3,
    "label": "Awesome"
  },
  {
    "type": "invoke-function-instruction",
    "functionName": "nop"
  }
]
```

(the above program, when run, will halt with [`1`, `3`] on the stack)

# ConciseText Representation

The ConciseText representation, is - as its name suggests - a lot more concise than the standard representation, but also slightly more difficult to parse. See [`src/grammars/ConciseText.g4`](src/grammars/ConciseText.g4) for an [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) grammar, and [`/reference/ConciseText.rrd.pdf`](/reference/ConciseText.rrd.pdf) for reference documentation.

Examples:

```text
1 "Awesome" goto 2 #Awesome nop
```
(encodes the same example as above)

```text
0 jgz { "hi" }
```

```text
"Hello" "," " world" rconcat rconcat
```
(will halt with `"Hello, world"` on the stack)
